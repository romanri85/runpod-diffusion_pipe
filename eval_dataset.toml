# Eval dataset configuration
# Place 5-15 images (with .txt caption files) in the eval_dataset_here/ folder.
# These images are used to measure loss during training — they are NOT used for training.
# This gives you a smooth loss curve in TensorBoard to detect overfitting.
# You can use a small subset of your training images if you don't have separate eval data.
